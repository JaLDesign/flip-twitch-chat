 **Reverse Scrolling Twitch Chat** (*or Top to Bottom Scrolling chat*)
Simply put this allows twitch chat to scroll from the top to the bottom. Ideal for streamers with cameras so they do not have to look down to see a message.

I built this because most of the workarounds I have seen online are either out dated or use `flex-direction: column-reverse;` with ends up inverting the full chat window cutting off the emote, bits menu and sends the top bits to the bottom too.

This simple just flips the chat window without needing to flip the message bar or top bits.
