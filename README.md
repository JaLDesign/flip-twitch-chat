 **Reverse Scrolling Twitch Chat** (*or Top to Bottom Scrolling chat*)
Simply put this allows twitch chat to scroll from the top to the bottom. Ideal for streamers with cameras so they do not have to look down to see a message.

I built this because most of the workarounds I have seen online are either out dated or use `flex-direction: column-reverse;` with ends up inverting the full chat window cutting off the emote, bits menu and sends the top bits to the bottom too.

This simple just flips the chat window without needing to flip the message bar or top bits.

**How to Install**

Personally I use the following plugin/addon's;

- On Chrome I use something called stylebot (click edit css, copy the code, save and boom) [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha")

- On Firefox I use Custom Style Script [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/custom-style-script/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/custom-style-script/ "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/custom-style-script/")

- On OBS you can simply add the code into the Custom CSS in the Browser Source

*This will work on any chromium based browser too. Brave, Vivaldi, Opera etc*

*Note:  Outside of Firefox and Chrome I can not guarantee that this will work*
